    <p class="question">Does a toxocariasis condition affect sigIa gut production?</p>
    <p class="question">Where can I test sigIa?</p>
    <p class="highlight" url="http://naturimedica.com/secretory-immunoglobulin-a-siga-for-healthy-gut-digestion-and-immunity/">The body’s mucosal surfaces such as those of the nose, throat, eyes and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are a large point of entry for various pathogens and thus must be well protected by the body. The primary antibody/ immune system response to these irritants at the mucosal level is sIgA produced by the B lymphocytes (immune system cells) present in the mucosal linings, including intestinal lining. sIgA acts as the ‘first line of defence’ helping to protect against the entrance of foreign substances into the body such bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and food particles (via the damaged gut wall).</p>
    <p class="highlight" url="http://naturimedica.com/secretory-immunoglobulin-a-siga-for-healthy-gut-digestion-and-immunity/">
      SIgA production is both beneficially and adversely affected by a number of factors including stress, emotions such as frustration and anger, nutrition, pathogens and inflammation. In particular, chronic and repeated bouts of acute stress suppress sIgA over time compromising the gut and the immune function. Even a relatively short-term sIgA deficiency due to acute stress predisposes a person to the development of food allergies or being susceptible to having pathogens in the GIT.
    </p>

      It is known that people with food sensitivities and especially food allergies have unusually low levels of sIgA making them particularly susceptible to gut damage and increase in immune response reactions.

      Secretion is adversely affected by stress which is mediated by cortisol produced by the adrenal glands. Thus low sIgA is very often present in adrenal depletion and adrenal fatigue/ exhaustion.

      Hi Leonardo

      Thank you for your comment. Yes, low levels of sIgA are strongly associated with the gut not working well because of conditions such as leaky gut, parasites, candida, SIBO, among others. Also, there is usually considerable gut and/or systemic inflammation happening as well to which the immune system reacts too. Please read my article on the GAPS diet for more information on gut/the immune system connection here http://naturimedica.com/gaps-diet-what-is-it-and-when-to-apply-it-sydney-australia/

      I suggest you look for a naturopath or other qualified natural medicine practitioner who is experienced in healing the gut and adrenals to embark on a comprehensive gut repair and adrenal boosting programs to start addressing the low sIgA levels. This is the first step to gauge what else may be going on healthwise.

      All the best
      Joanna
